      <h2 class="text-5xl text-center font-semibold">What is the<br>Project Workshop?</h2>
      <h3 class="text-2xl text-center font-semibold">Meetings on Wednesdays in KEC 1001 @ 7-8pm</h3>
      <p class="text-justify">
        The Project Workshop takes place during the second hour of the AI Club's meetings, and is a place for students to work
        on individual machine learning projects with structured guidance and peer support. Students follow a 10-week roadmap
        designed to take them from project conception to deployment, regardless of their prior experience with coding or AI.
        Participants have the flexibility to choose their own project topics and spend most of their time coding,
        experimenting, and iterating on their models rather than sitting through lectures. By the end of the term, students
        will have completed a portfolio-ready project that demonstrates practical AI skills to potential employers or graduate
        programs.
